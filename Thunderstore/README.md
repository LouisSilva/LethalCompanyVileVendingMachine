Adds a new Entity and 2 New Scrap to Lethal Company.
Fully Compatible with v64


# Information:
The Vile Vending Machine is a dangerous but entirely passive entity. At no point will it chase you down or kill you of its own volition.
It's your own greed that will cause your death when interacting with it...

You're given the opportunity to trade scrap for a unique item that's worth more then a regular Cola, The Company Cola, this comes at a high risk. The Vile Vending Machine has a chance to grab you, killing you and turning you into a Company Cola instead.

Are you really willing to risk your life for a Cola...?
